## Installation

This application can be forked from my repository. After you fork it you will need to set
up your own database if you want all of the functions of the app to work. You can start the 
server locally with "node server" and than run the application by cd'ing into the client folder
and running "npm start". 

## Description

This application uses the google books api to search for book titles and also to save any
book that you want for later if you want to revisit it or possibly purchase it from the google 
books website. This application was built using "node", "express" and "react" as well as making a call to the google api.
